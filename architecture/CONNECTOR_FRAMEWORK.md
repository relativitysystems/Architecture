# Connector Framework

Source repository: `relativitysystems/Relativity`. All connector/integration code lives here — AIKB is provider-agnostic and only ever receives normalized ingestion calls or signed knowledge queries (see [AIKB.md](AIKB.md), [INGESTION_PIPELINE.md](INGESTION_PIPELINE.md)).

## Overview

Two external connectors exist today:

| Connector | Auth model | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| **Slack** | Encrypted OAuth (`oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials`), hashed server-side state, HMAC-verified events, idempotent event log | Fully modernized reference implementation |
| **Google Drive** | None — a browser-obtained-token Picker import only; no persistent connection | One-shot document import only, by design (see below) |

**Dropbox has been removed entirely (backlog M15).** It previously had an encrypted OAuth connect/status flow (`oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials`, backlog H2) but no working import path was ever built — `services/dropboxService.js#listFiles()` was orphaned code with no calling route, so Connect stored a credential nothing ever read back. Google Drive's equivalent persistent-connection flow (`GET /auth/google/start`/`callback`, `googleDriveService.js`) was removed for the same reason: it existed only as scaffolding for a future recurring "Knowledge Sync" feature that was never built and isn't scheduled (see [CONNECTOR_ROADMAP.md](../roadmap/CONNECTOR_ROADMAP.md)), and it duplicated — inconsistently — the one-shot Picker import that already served the client's actual use case. See [CLIENT_PORTAL.md](../product/CLIENT_PORTAL.md) for the portal-facing UI change.

Slack is the connector to model any future integration (Gmail, Outlook, Teams) on **if that integration ingests data into AIKB's knowledge store**. This document describes what actually exists for each connector, then extracts the pattern Slack established so a future ingestion-based connector can reuse it.

**Not every future connector fits this shape.** A live-query connector — one that answers from a provider's current state at question time rather than a synchronized copy (CRM is the first planned example; Gmail live mailbox lookup is a second, proposed example — see [LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md](LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md)) — does not ingest, embed, or assign a collection at all. [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-LIVE-TOOL-CALLS-ORCHESTRATED-BY-AIKB.md) governs that shape: AIKB orchestrates a bounded tool call and generates the answer from a live result, Relativity is still the only thing that ever holds the credential or calls the provider API (so ADR-001 still applies unchanged), but steps 4–5 below (collection assignment, embedding/storage) do not apply. Before modeling a new connector on the pattern in this document, decide which shape it is — ingestion (this document) or live tool call (ADR-010) — they are not interchangeable. Notably, Gmail is the first connector in this platform proposed to have **both** shapes simultaneously: [EMAIL_INGESTION.md](EMAIL_INGESTION.md)'s existing ingestion pipeline (this document's shape) and [LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md](LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md)'s proposed live-tool-call layer (ADR-010's shape) — one provider connection, two independent, non-overlapping query mechanisms, sharing OAuth credentials and normalization code but nothing about how content reaches a model.

## Current Implementation

### Google Drive

Google Drive has exactly one integration surface: a one-shot, browser-token Picker import on the Documents tab. There is no OAuth connect flow and no persistent connection (backlog M15 removed it — see above).

- **Auth**: `GET /api/google-drive/picker-config` hands the browser a client ID/API key so the frontend runs Google's own JS picker and obtains its own short-lived access token client-side, sent as an `x-google-access-token` header to `POST /api/google-drive/import`. No server-side token exchange, storage, or refresh happens anywhere in this flow.
- **Normalization**: MIME allow-list (PDF, DOCX, `text/plain`, `text/markdown`) enforced before download; no content transformation happens in Relativity — raw bytes are handed to AIKB unchanged.
- **Trigger**: one-shot, user-initiated only (Picker selection). No polling, webhook, or ongoing sync exists. (The apiKey-protected `GET /api/google-drive/files/:clientId`/`file/:clientId/:fileId` routes once documented here as a theoretical external-automation entry point were confirmed to have zero live callers and an unconfigured `API_KEY` — dead code, removed per backlog L9.)
- **Handoff / collection assignment / embedding / storage**: identical to every other source — `aikbService.uploadAndIngest` uploads to AIKB's Storage bucket, calls `POST /api/knowledge/ingest` tagged `sourceProvider: 'portal_upload'`, and the document is assigned to the client's default collection at first insert, exactly as described in [INGESTION_PIPELINE.md](INGESTION_PIPELINE.md).

### Slack — Reference Implementation

Mounted at `/api/integrations/slack` (`routes/integrations/slack.js`):

```
GET  /api/integrations/slack/start        clientAuth, requireOwnerAdmin
GET  /api/integrations/slack/callback     (public — resolves identity only from server-side state)
GET  /api/integrations/slack/status       clientAuth
POST /api/integrations/slack/disconnect   clientAuth, requireOwnerAdmin
GET  /api/integrations/slack/collections  clientAuth
PUT  /api/integrations/slack/collections  clientAuth, requireOwnerAdmin
POST /api/integrations/slack/events       verifySlackSignatureMiddleware
POST /api/integrations/slack/deliver      requireServiceRequest (AIKB → Relativity, reversed envelope)
```

`GET /api/integrations/slack/sweep` no longer exists — removed per [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md); see below.

**The old flow is retired, not deleted quietly.** `GET/POST /auth/slack/start` and `/callback` now return HTTP `410 Gone` with an explanatory error — the old flow trusted an unsigned, client-supplied `clientId` in its OAuth `state` and stored tokens in plaintext; both were replaced outright rather than patched. AIKB's own former Slack Events handler (`aikb/routes/slack.js`) is likewise retired: it still verifies signatures and answers Slack's `url_verification` challenge (so Slack's app configuration doesn't 404), but every `event_callback` is logged (without message content or tokens) and answered `410 Gone` — no retrieval, no answer generation, no posting back to Slack happens in AIKB anymore. The safe replacement lives entirely in Relativity, described below.

**OAuth install**:
1. `GET /start` generates a cryptographically random 32-byte state, stores only its **SHA-256 hash** server-side (`oauth_states`, 10-minute TTL) together with the session-resolved `client_id`/`member_id` — the raw state value is sent to Slack but never persisted or logged.
2. `GET /callback` is public (no bearer token) but resolves organization/member identity **only** from the `oauth_states` row matched by the returned state's hash — never from anything the browser or Slack supplies directly. Single-use consumption is enforced by one atomic conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE state_hash = $1 AND consumed_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()`, so two concurrent callbacks for the same state can never both succeed.
3. Requested scopes are minimal: `app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`.
4. The exchanged bot token is encrypted (AES-256-GCM, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) and written atomically — connection metadata and encrypted credential together — via the `replace_active_oauth_connection` Postgres function, which revokes any prior active connection for the same `(client_id, provider)` in the same transaction as inserting the new one.

**Event ingestion & tenant mapping**:
- `POST /events` is verified via HMAC-SHA256 over the raw request body (`v0:{timestamp}:{rawBody}`, 300-second replay window, constant-time comparison) before any other processing.
- Tenant mapping is a **single lookup**: the active `oauth_connections` row for `(provider='slack', external_account_id=team_id)`. There is no separate channel-to-client mapping table — the whole Slack workspace maps to one client.
- Only `app_mention` events with no `subtype` and no `bot_id` are processed; self-mentions (the bot mentioning itself) are dropped by comparing against the connection's stored `bot_user_id`.
- The question text is extracted by stripping the leading `<@BOT_ID>` mention, capped at 2000 characters.
- **Idempotency**: every event is recorded in `slack_event_log`, keyed by `UNIQUE(provider, external_event_id)` — the first delivery of a Slack event inserts and proceeds; every redelivery hits the unique constraint and is acknowledged `200` with no further processing, including a redelivery arriving after the original event already reached a terminal state. Status is a small state machine: `received -> enqueued -> answered -> delivered` (terminal), or one of two distinct terminal failure states — `failed` (an AIKB-generation-failure notification that itself couldn't be sent) or `delivery_failed` (bounded Slack-delivery retries exhausted; see below and [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md)).

**Collection-scoped retrieval**: the question is sent to AIKB's `POST /api/knowledge/ask` inside a signed service-request envelope carrying `allowedCollectionIds`, resolved fresh at request time from `slack_collection_access` (a per-client join table of allowed `collection_id`s managed via `GET/PUT /api/integrations/slack/collections`). An empty allow-list means "search nothing," never "search everything" — this is enforced inside AIKB's retrieval SQL itself (see [AIKB.md](AIKB.md)).

**Delivery back to Slack**: AIKB calls back `POST /api/integrations/slack/deliver` once an answer is ready, authenticated by a **reversed** signed envelope (AIKB signs, Relativity verifies via `requireServiceRequest`). The handler looks up the event row by idempotency key, atomically claims it (`enqueued -> answered`, so only one delivery attempt ever proceeds even under a race), formats the message, and calls `chat.postMessage` with the client's decrypted bot token. If that call fails, the answer-delivery leg gets bounded, immediate, in-flow retries (see below) before landing on a terminal state — it does not simply mark the row failed on the first failure the way it did before [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md).

**Retry sweep — removed, not merely deprecated**: `GET /api/integrations/slack/sweep` and its `cronSweepAuthService.js`/`CRON_SECRET` bearer-secret auth have been deleted from `relativitysystems/Relativity`, along with the `slackEventsService.js`/`slackEventLogService.js` sweep-only helper functions that backed it (`runDeliverySweep`, `retryStuckRow`, `bestEffortFailureReply`, `listStuckForRetry`, `incrementAttempt`). No Vercel Cron entry, external scheduler, or Railway-side scheduled job exists or is planned for Slack delivery, per the product decision in [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md). This is not a "not yet restored" state — the endpoint and its supporting code are gone.

**Implemented design — bounded delivery retries and terminal `delivery_failed`**: Slack delivery failure and AIKB generation failure are handled differently, exactly as ADR-007 specifies:

- **AIKB generation failure** (AIKB cannot produce an answer, but Slack communication is still functioning): a brief error response is sent to the Slack user (`slackDeliverService.js`, the `payload.error === true` branch), the processing attempt is marked with the pre-existing generic `failed` status, and the event terminates. Single attempt, no retry — this path is unchanged by ADR-007 by design, since Slack itself is reachable here.
- **Slack delivery failure** (AIKB generated an answer, but the callback to `POST /api/integrations/slack/deliver` or the subsequent `chat.postMessage` call cannot reach or be accepted by Slack): `slackDeliverService.js` retries the `chat.postMessage` call via `services/retryWithBackoff.js` — **3 total attempts by default** (initial + 2 retries), **2s then 5s backoff**, both configurable via `SLACK_DELIVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`/`SLACK_DELIVERY_BACKOFF_MS` — still within the same request/processing pass, never via a background scheduler. If delivery still fails after those attempts, the `slack_event_log` row is marked with a terminal status, `delivery_failed`, via `slackEventLogService.js#markDeliveryFailed`, and processing of that event stops permanently. Because sending an error notification to the Slack user depends on the same unavailable Slack API, a delivery failure **cannot always** notify the user — unlike an AIKB generation failure, where Slack itself is reachable. The same bounded-retry-then-`delivery_failed` treatment was also extended to the initial synchronous accept-and-enqueue call to AIKB's `POST /api/knowledge/ask` and to the empty-question direct Slack reply (`slackEventsService.js`) — an implementation decision made beyond ADR-007's literal text, to avoid a row getting permanently stuck at `received` now that the sweep no longer exists as a backstop. See [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md)'s Implementation Status section for the full detail.

On reaching `delivery_failed`, the row's customer content is redacted in both repositories:

- **Relativity**: `slackEventLogService.js#markDeliveryFailed` sets `status`, `failed_at`, `error_code`, `attempt_count`, and `question = null` in a single UPDATE — the row is never observably `delivery_failed` with its question still attached.
- **AIKB**: Relativity's `services/aikbRedactClient.js` makes a **best-effort, single-attempt** signed callback to AIKB's `POST /api/knowledge/chat/redact` (`aikb/routes/knowledge.js`, `requireServiceRequest`-gated identically to `/ask`), which nulls the matching chat session's `title` and every message's `content` (replaced with a fixed marker — the column is `NOT NULL`), `sources`, and `metadata` by `clientId`/`idempotencyKey`. **This AIKB-side callback is not itself retried** — a failure is logged and swallowed, never surfaced to Slack or retried later, since ADR-007 rules out any scheduled process. Relativity's own redaction is unconditional and happens first; AIKB's is best-effort only. See [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md) for the full tradeoff, stated explicitly rather than hidden.

Only technical metadata needed for Slack event deduplication, basic debugging, delivery-attempt auditing, and client identification is retained: `external_event_id`, `client_id`, `status = 'delivery_failed'`, `attempt_count`, `error_code`, and `failed_at` on the Relativity side; session/message ids, timestamps, `origin`/`origin_metadata`, and `idempotency_key` on the AIKB side. The `slack_event_log.status` column remains unconstrained `text` — `delivery_failed` was an application-logic change, not a migration (see [TABLES.md](../docs/supabase/global/TABLES.md)). The user can ask the question again manually if they still need an answer; no scheduled process ever revisits a `delivery_failed` row. A resend of the same Slack `event_id` after the original reached `delivery_failed` is still deduped at `insertReceived` and never reprocessed, verified by test. Technical-metadata retention duration (ADR-007 suggested 7–30 days) remains an open TODO — see [../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md).

**Verification checklist** (manual or automated, before relying on this behavior in a new environment). Items 2, 4, and 7 require a real Slack workspace and write real data — run them against a dedicated staging environment, not production; see [STAGING_ENVIRONMENT.md](STAGING_ENVIRONMENT.md) for the setup plan and that document's revised item-by-item status:

1. Run the full `relativitysystems/Relativity` test suite (`npm test`) and the full `relativitysystems/aikb` test suite — both must be green.
2. Ask a real question via Slack; confirm a normal reply, `slack_event_log.status = 'delivered'`, `attempt_count = 1`.
3. Confirm retry-then-success and all-attempts-exhausted behavior via the automated tests in `Relativity/test/slackDeliverService.test.js` and `Relativity/test/slackEventsService.test.js` (these inject failures deterministically — do not invalidate a production Slack bot token to force a real failure).
4. On a terminal `delivery_failed` row, confirm `question` is `null` in Relativity and the corresponding AIKB `knowledge_chat_sessions`/`knowledge_chat_messages` content is redacted, while `idempotency_key`, `external_event_id`, `client_id`, `attempt_count`, and timestamps remain.
5. Resend the same Slack event (or replay the same `event_id` in a test) after a `delivery_failed` row exists; confirm it is deduped, not reprocessed, and no delayed answer is ever posted.
6. Confirm `GET /api/integrations/slack/sweep` returns `404` (route removed) and no cron/scheduled job exists anywhere in either deployment (Vercel, Railway/Inngest) that calls it.
7. After any test run, reconnect/verify the Slack workspace connection still works for a fresh question — bounded-retry testing should never leave the connection in a broken state.

**Full real-account QA of the Slack surface**: the checklist above verifies delivery mechanics in isolation. [EM10_5_SLACK_VALIDATION.md](EM10_5_SLACK_VALIDATION.md) is the hands-on execution record for Slack as a **knowledge-search surface** end to end — collection access (`slack_collection_access` fail-closed), portal-vs-Slack retrieval parity, citation integrity, tenant isolation, channel-vs-DM behavior, thread placement, and the async delivery/idempotency paths above re-verified against a real workspace. It is a companion to [EM10_5_STAGING_CHECKLIST.md](EM10_5_STAGING_CHECKLIST.md) under the same milestone, not a separate one.

## Architecture — The Reusable Connector Pattern

The following pattern is observed directly in the Slack implementation and is the shape a future **ingestion-based** connector (Gmail, Outlook, Teams) should follow — a **live-query** connector (CRM) follows [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-LIVE-TOOL-CALLS-ORCHESTRATED-BY-AIKB.md) instead, skipping steps 4–5 entirely. It is *not* a formal framework/interface enforced by the codebase today — Google Drive's one-shot Picker import predates it and was never retrofitted onto it (nor does it need to be — it isn't an ongoing connection) — but it is the consistent shape of every Milestone-4/5-era service.

```

Concretely, a future connector should:

1. **Authentication** — implement `GET /api/integrations/{provider}/start` (session-resolved `clientId`, never trust one from the browser) and `/callback` (exchange code, persist via the shared `oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials` tables). The `oauth_connections.provider` CHECK constraint still lists `slack`, `microsoft`, `gmail`, `google_drive`, `dropbox` — the schema remains provider-generic even though only Slack is actually migrated onto it today (Google Drive and Dropbox's persistent-connection flows were removed entirely per backlog M15; `google_drive`/`dropbox` stay valid CHECK values only in case a real recurring-sync connector is built for either later). Use `oauthStateService`'s hashed, single-use, server-side state pattern — still provider-generic and available to any new connector — for any new one too.
2. **Normalization** — verify the inbound request's authenticity (signature, bearer token, or provider-specific mechanism) before any other processing, and resolve the tenant **only** from a trusted server-side lookup (an active `oauth_connections` row keyed by the provider's own account/workspace identifier) — never from a client-supplied `clientId` in the payload. This is precisely the failure mode the original AIKB Slack prototype had, and precisely what the current Slack implementation replaced.
3. **Processing** — extract the normalized unit of work (a question string, or file bytes) with the same discipline as Slack's `slackQuestionService` (strip provider-specific wrapper syntax, cap length) or the ingestion routes (extension/MIME allow-lists, size caps).
4. **Collection assignment** — for document sources, assign the client's default collection at first ingest, same as every existing source. For query sources, resolve an `allowedCollectionIds` list from a per-client, per-provider allow-list table (following the `slack_collection_access` join-table shape) and pass it inside the signed envelope, fail-closed on an empty/missing list. **Does not apply to a live-query connector** — see [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-LIVE-TOOL-CALLS-ORCHESTRATED-BY-AIKB.md); there is no ingested document to assign a collection to.
5. **Embedding / Storage** — never implement provider-specific parsing, chunking, or embedding. Every existing source funnels through the identical `uploadAndIngest` → AIKB `/ingest` → Inngest pipeline; a new connector should do the same rather than inventing its own indexing path. **Does not apply to a live-query connector** — per [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-LIVE-TOOL-CALLS-ORCHESTRATED-BY-AIKB.md), a tool-call result is request-scoped context for one answer, never embedded or stored.
6. **Querying** — never implement provider-specific retrieval logic. Call AIKB's existing `/ask` (or `/query`) contract with a signed service-request envelope, exactly as Slack does. This is the architectural lesson embedded directly in the codebase's own history: AIKB's original Slack prototype ran its own retrieval, bypassing the platform's session/gap/authorization logic, and was retired specifically because of that — see the retirement comment in `aikb/routes/slack.js` and migration `20260714_oauth_connections.sql`.

**Shared conventions already established** that a new connector should reuse rather than reinvent:
- Service factory pattern: `create{X}Service(client)` for test injection, alongside a ready-made default singleton (used by `oauthConnectionsService`, `oauthStateService`, `slackIntegrationService`, `slackEventLogService`, `slackCollectionAccessService`).
- Encrypted credential storage: `oauth_connections` (metadata) + `oauth_credentials` (AES-256-GCM ciphertext, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), written atomically via a single Postgres RPC rather than separate client-side inserts.
- Idempotency/event-log pattern: a per-provider event log table keyed by `UNIQUE(provider, external_event_id)`, with a small `received → enqueued → answered → delivered/failed` state machine, for any provider whose events can be redelivered (webhooks, at-least-once queues).

## Current Limitations

- ~~Google Drive and Dropbox are not on the encrypted `oauth_connections` model.~~ **Resolved (backlog H2), then removed entirely (backlog M15).** Both briefly wrote through `oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials`, the same model Slack uses, before their persistent-connection flows were removed outright as unused scaffolding — see the Overview section above. `upsertToken`/`getToken` in `supabaseService.js` are unchanged and still exist, but nothing calls them for any provider anymore.
- ~~Google Drive has two inconsistent auth paths~~ **Resolved (backlog M15).** The persistent OAuth connection is gone; only the one-shot Picker-obtained browser token remains, so there is now exactly one auth path for Drive.
- ~~Dropbox has no working import path in this repository~~ **Resolved (backlog M15).** Rather than build one, the entire Dropbox connector (Connect/status, no import) was removed — it had no working functionality to preserve.
- **Slack delivery does not guarantee eventual delivery, by design.** Bounded, immediate delivery retries followed by a terminal `delivery_failed` status (implemented, see above) replace the sweep entirely — there is no scheduled recovery of any kind. A sustained Slack outage longer than the retry window can still lose an answer; the user must ask again. See [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md).
- **AIKB-side redaction on `delivery_failed` is best-effort, not guaranteed.** If the redaction callback to AIKB fails, Relativity's own `slack_event_log.question` is still correctly redacted, but the corresponding AIKB chat session/message content can remain un-redacted with no automatic retry. See [ADR-007](../decisions/ADR-007-SLACK-BOUNDED-DELIVERY-RETRY.md)'s Implementation Status section.
- **No monitoring or alerting exists for a rise in `delivery_failed` events or failed AIKB redaction callbacks** — both are currently only visible in application logs. See [../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md).
- **Technical-metadata retention for terminal Slack events is undecided.** ADR-007 suggested 7–30 days; no cleanup mechanism exists in either repository yet (`Relativity/services/slackEventLogService.js` carries an explicit TODO). See [../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](../roadmap/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md).
- **The connector pattern above is observed, not enforced.** Nothing in the codebase prevents a future connector from bypassing it (e.g., implementing its own retrieval) the way the original AIKB Slack prototype did — there is no shared base class or interface that new connector code must implement.

## Future Extension Points

- The `oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials` schema already anticipates `microsoft`, `gmail`, `google_drive`, `dropbox` as provider values — a Gmail, Outlook/Teams, or a real recurring-sync Google Drive/Dropbox connector's credential storage requires no new table, only a new adapter following the pattern above.
- **CRM systems follow [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-LIVE-TOOL-CALLS-ORCHESTRATED-BY-AIKB.md), not the ingestion pattern above.** Credential storage still reuses `oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials` (a `provider` CHECK value, e.g. `hubspot`, would be added the same way `microsoft`/`gmail` were anticipated), but there is no ingestion adapter to build — a CRM connector is a bounded, named tool (e.g. `search_crm_contacts`) executed by Relativity and orchestrated by AIKB's generation call, with no document, embedding, or collection ever created.
- **Gmail live mailbox lookup (proposed, [LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md](LIVE_EMAIL_LOOKUP.md)) is the second connector proposed to follow ADR-010's shape**, and the first to do so *alongside* an already-shipped ingestion connector for the same provider rather than instead of one — reusing Gmail's existing `oauth_connections` row, `gmailService.js`'s API primitives, and `emailNormalizationService.js` unchanged, adding only a new, bounded, read-only tool-execution path (`POST /api/tools/execute`) that never ingests.
- `slack_collection_access`'s join-table shape (rather than an array column) is explicitly designed, per its own migration comment, "as the natural extension point for a future `principal_type`/`principal_id` pair (per-group or per-user scoping)" — i.e., moving from organization-wide allow-lists to finer-grained entitlement would not require a schema migration off the current table shape.
- ~~Migrating Google Drive and Dropbox onto the encrypted `oauth_connections` model~~ — done, backlog H2, then reverted, backlog M15 (see Overview). If a real "Knowledge Sync" (recurring ingestion) feature is ever built for either provider, `oauth_connections`/`oauth_credentials` is still the right place to store its credentials — rebuild the connect flow alongside the sync engine that would actually drive it, not standalone in advance. `microsoft` and `gmail` remain in the provider list with no adapter built yet; their credential storage requires no new migration, only a new OAuth adapter following this same pattern.
